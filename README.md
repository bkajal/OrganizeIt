Frontend (React): Utilizes modern React hooks (useState, useEffect, Fragment) for efficient and maintainable UI management. Runs on localhost:3000 for a smooth development experience. 
Backend (Node.js with Express): Leverages the Express framework to establish a robust server running on localhost:5000. Employs CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to enable seamless communication between frontend and backend despite different ports. 
Connects to a PostgreSQL database for secure and scalable data storage. 
Functionality: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for to-do list management.
